2022-03-02 Release 1.5.0

	"Rumors of my death greatly exaggerated" - It's Gomacs 1.5.0!

	Back for the first release in two and a half years, and a great
	improvement at that. Gomacs enters the new decade with a new
	contributor (ixtenu) and a host of improvements.

	In other news, Gomacs enters the brave new world of modules! Yeah,
	it's old, so what?

	This really will be the last 1.x.x release before 2.0.0; we
	already have a bunch of changes lined up for that.

	Features:
	* "Smart" unindent - try backspacing on your Python files!
	* Insert tabs into prompts - You can now search or replace them.
	* Syntax highlighting for Forth and Zygomys
	* +LINUM syntax - now you can open Gomacs from less(1)!

	Bugfixes:
	* Fix a long-standing rendering issue after pasting
	* Fix a crash after C-x 1
	* Fix cursor position on empty lines
	* Fix a hang in query-replace-regexp
	* UTF-8 fix

	Tweaks:
	* Point position by column, not bytes-in-line
	* Remove an old easter egg
	* Proper tabstop behavior
	* Fill behavior tweaks

2019-09-28 Release 1.4.0

	CHANGE DA GOMACS, MY FINAL MESSAGE, GOODB YE!

	Yep, I told a lie in the last changelog ;) We're here, we're
	queer, we're Gomacs 1.4.0! This is largely a feature release.
	Some of these changes were too important to wait for 2.0.0.
	I like the go-gettable Gomacs to be as rad as possible, so now
	that we're stable again, it makes sense to merge.

	* Horizontal windows!
	* Window management commands
	* Yank from the clipboard into the minibuffer
	* Updated syntax files

2019-08-10 Release 1.3.0

	What's that coming over the hill, is it a Gomacs, is it a Gomacs?

	It sure is, and at long last! After over a year since the last
	release, and giving us a nice round number at 256 commits, it's
	Gomacs 1.3.0!

	Features:
	* Transpose words and transpose chars with M-t and C-t
	* Shell commands have a much better interface now
	* Syntax highlighting for gbz80 and Inform 6
	* Auto-fill mode

	Bugfixes:
	* Crashes are rarer than ever ;)

	Tweaks:
	* Syntax improvements as compared to upstream
	* Fill-column behaves as it should now (fixed an off-by-one)
	* constant.specialChar entities are highlighted in yellow now
	* M-q is now fill-paragraph-or-region

	This will probably be the last big release to be tagged 1.*.*, as
	my problems with Gomacs now are of a wider scale. Let's look at
	some possible improvements for 2.0.0!

	* Zygomys for our Lisp again
	* Lisp features from GNU Emacs
	* Pasting tweaks (it's the last visual bug in Gomacs, but a tricky one)
	* Horizontal windows (which would require rewriting a lot of draw code!)

	I'm also thinking of release engineering here! The master branch
	should now be for releases only. I'll branch it off to a separate
	develop branch for those 2.0.0 tweaks (this means go-get should be
	much less risky, as you'll be getting one signed-off for release
	instead).

2018-07-07 Release 1.2.1

	Bugfix release - fix out-of-bounds on `goto-line`

2018-07-07 Release 1.2.0

	Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No! It's Gomacs 1.2.0! This release is the
	biggest yet, and easily the most satisfied I've ever been with this
	weird side-project of mine.

	Features:
	* Mouse support
	* Syntax files extended and updated

	Bugfixes:
	* Allow empty files (fixing a crash)
	* Fix region weirdness (regions were fiddling with the undos)
	* Fix screen refreshing race condition
	* Fix highlighting breakage
	* Fix a divide-by-zero crash
	* Fix some crashes and edge-cases by removing a legacy feature (see
	  tweaks section below)

	Tweaks:
	* Disallow moving outside of the buffer - this is a weird Emacs quirk
	  that doesn't really suit Gomacs
	* Use uemacs-style scrolling (line-by-line) for long lines
	* `capitalize-word` now uses Lowercase â†’ Title
	* TODO comments now highlighted (in as distasteful a way as possible)

	Furthermore, for all you lisp-haters and sucklessers, there now exists a
	"lite" version of Gomacs! This version removes all Lisp support from the
	editor; reducing the binary size at the expense of Gomacs'
	extensibility. This leaves the bindings hard-coded in, though I'm sure
	you don't mind that ;) To try it for yourself, check-out and build the
	"lite" branch.

	Happy hacking!

2017-08-26 Release 1.1.0

	The release that should've been 1.0.0 - it's Gomacs 1.1.0!
	Featuring some important new features, bugfixes, and a ton of tweaks.

	Features:
	* Rectangles
	* Zmacs regions
	* `suspend-emacs` ported to all POSIX platforms

	Bugfixes:
	* Concurrent magic tricks to fix the "slow pasting" problem
	* Disable `terminal-title-mode` on non-Linux platforms
	* All actions can now be undone/redone in one go
	* Major mode and highlighting can change when file is saved/renamed
	* Re-write fill commands
	* Correct behaviour of `what-cursor`
